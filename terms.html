      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the NightHalo mobile application (the “App”).

      If you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> NightHalo provides forecast and guidance information only. It is not a safety device.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      NightHalo is provided by NightHalo / Decanus LTD (“we”, “us”, “our”).
      For support: <em>support@getcruza.com</em> (replace with your real support email).
    </p>

    <h2>2) Licence to use the App</h2>
    <p>
      We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes,
      subject to these Terms and any applicable app store rules.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Acceptable use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not misuse the App, interfere with its operation, or attempt to access it using a method other than the interface we provide.</li>
      <li>Do not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where allowed by law.</li>
      <li>Do not use the App to break the law or infringe others’ rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Forecast accuracy and disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      NightHalo uses third-party data sources (including space weather and weather forecast providers). Forecasts can be wrong or delayed.
      You should always use common sense and local conditions when planning viewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties,
      including fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Safety</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for your own safety. Do not use the App in a way that distracts you while driving, riding, or operating machinery.
      Always obey local laws, respect private property, and follow any applicable guidance in your area.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Alerts</h2>
    <p>
      Alerts are best-effort and depend on your device settings, permissions, and system behaviour. We do not guarantee that alerts will be delivered,
      timely, or accurate.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      The App and its content (excluding third-party data and trademarks) are owned by us or our licensors and protected by intellectual property laws.
      You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App except as permitted by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Third-party services and links</h2>
    <p>
      The App may interact with third-party services (e.g., forecast providers, mapping services). We do not control those services and are not responsible
      for their content, availability, or accuracy. Your use of those services may be governed by their own terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you breach these Terms or if we discontinue the App. You may stop using the App at any time
      by uninstalling it.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss
      of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of (or inability to use) the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded under law (for example, liability for death or personal injury caused by
      negligence, or fraud).
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to the App or Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update the App and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date” on this page.
      Continuing to use the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction, except where
      consumer law in your country provides otherwise.
