      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        NightHalo (the “App”) • Effective date: <strong>2026-01-03</strong>

  <main>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how NightHalo (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the NightHalo mobile application.
      If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Quick summary:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We use your <strong>approximate or precise location</strong> only if you enable location permissions (for local aurora forecasts).</li>
        <li>We fetch aurora and weather data from third-party providers (e.g., NOAA, Open-Meteo) using your location coordinates.</li>
        <li>We store your preferences (like alert settings and chosen location) on your device.</li>
        <li>We don’t sell your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      The controller of your personal data is NightHalo. If you need to contact us about privacy:
      <br />
      <strong>Email:</strong> <em>privacy@getcruza.com</em> (replace with your real support email)
    </p>

    <h2>2) What information we collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <p>
      NightHalo does not require you to create an account. You may optionally enter a custom location by searching for a place name.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Device information</h3>
    <p>
      We may process basic device and app information for functionality and stability (e.g., OS version, app version), typically via platform diagnostics.
      We do not intentionally collect special category data.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Location data</h3>
    <p>
      If you enable location permissions, the App will access your device location to show local aurora probability and related forecast details.
      You can turn this off anytime in the App settings or your device settings and use a custom location instead.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 App preferences stored on your device</h3>
    <p>
      The App stores preferences locally on your device (e.g., whether alerts are enabled, minimum probability threshold, alert window, quiet hours, and chosen location).
      This storage is used to remember your settings between sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>3) How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide the App’s core features (aurora probability, direction guidance, best viewing time).</li>
      <li>Enable alerts and respect your chosen preferences (where supported by your device).</li>
      <li>Improve reliability and troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Legal bases (UK GDPR / EU GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
      Where applicable, we process personal data under the following legal bases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> — for precise location (where you choose to enable it).</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — to maintain and secure the App, prevent abuse, and improve performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong> — to provide the service you request by using the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Sharing and third parties</h2>
    <p>
      We may share limited information only as needed to provide the App:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Forecast and geocoding providers</strong> (e.g., NOAA and Open-Meteo): We send coordinates or a search query to retrieve forecast results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Platform providers</strong> (Apple / Google): The App may use platform services for crash diagnostics or distribution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We do not share personal data for behavioural advertising unless explicitly stated in an updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>6) International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Some service providers may process data outside the UK/EEA. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses).
    </p>

    <h2>7) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      App preferences are stored on your device until you clear the App’s data or uninstall it.
      We do not run user accounts, so we generally do not retain identifiable user profiles on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, and portability.
      You can also withdraw location consent at any time by disabling location permissions.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Children</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country).
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the “Effective date”.
    </p>
